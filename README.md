## Sending Requests

If sending requests to the server from outside HelpingHandsCloud module in android Client, the header should contain device_fingerprint generated by the Cloud Module. This header is automatically added if you are using cloud module.

```javascript
 device_fingerprint: {
                      SHA_fingerprint:"zM7CDz7zzo24Mhs/h0y9fRoMBwEFHahXQM+n5lesKJ8=",
                      clientID:"68570763210eabbb",
                      packageName:"com.jstechnologies.helpinghands"
                      }
```

Below is a sample Post body for Read request. Payload must contain Address generated by Geolocation API in android and the collection name.

```javascript
{
  collectionName: 'services_data',
  payload: {
    addressLine1: '117, Karkar Duma, Ram Vihar, Anand Vihar, Delhi, 110092, India',
    city: 'Delhi',
    country: 'India',
    lat: 28.650216666666665,
    lon: 77.302705,
    pincode: '110092',
    state: 'Delhi'
  },
  requestType: 'READ'
}
```
## Features
* No Login/Signup. Anyone can access the free database with this app.
* Show all services near you with Geolocation.
* Only accept authorized requests from clients ( as defined in config.json)
* Anyone can add a new service as a contact (within one's state).
* The probability of finding a service depends on the distance, rating, and verification status of the service provider.
* Tailored to include mobile numbers only from India for Now.
* Search any service provider by name, services, phone number or tags.
* Ability to vote or downvote any service provider anonymously.

## Goals :fire:
- [x] No Login/Signup.
- [x] Identify device using unique ID.
- [x] Consume Rest API Endpoints in a easier and cleaner way.
- [x] Ability to work without network connections (Once the data is fetched from server, it is stored in LocalDB unless new data is available).
- [x] Generate matches tailored for every user by location and rating.
- [x] Develop a scoring system for backend which generates match nearest and most trusted to you.
- [x] No user data is stored in the server. User is always anonymous. 
- [x] Add service contacts.
- [ ] Service contact verification (By phone ).
- [ ] Filter services by location, date, rating, etc.
